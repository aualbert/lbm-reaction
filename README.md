# lbm-reaction
A Lattice Boltzmann method with reactions to model E. coli growth.
This simulation was written as part of the initiation to research course of the MPRI.

## Lattice Boltzmann method
what was done (question, problems, solutions), was could be improved 

## E. coli modelization 
what was done (question, problems, solutions), other envisioned models, what is done in the literature

## Usage 

#### Requirements
With nix installed, simply type `nix develop`. Otherwise, the following packages are needed:
- python with matplotlib, numpy and imagio
- ffmpeg 

#### Running a simulation
TODO
